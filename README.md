Real-time Stock Price Data Visualization using Python
To create a realtime stock price data visualization application, I will be using the streamlit library in Python. In this task, we can use the streamlit library to create an interactive user interface where a user will enter the name of any company and the stock price data will be visualized as the final output.

For the task of visualizing stock prices, we can use any data visualization library in Python compatible with the streamlit framework. But to keep it simple, Iâ€™ll be using the matplotlib library in Python. Now below is how you can create a real-time stock price data visualization application using Python:

Make sure that you run this Python code in an IDE or a code editor. To run your file just execute the streamlit run filename.py in your terminal. In the output, you will get to see a user interface as shown below.
